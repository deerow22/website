        Welcome to a page about me
    </h2>
    <p>
        First thing to know is I love astronomy. Looking at all the pictures is so cool! But collecting the pictures is the best. Astronomy drew me towards STEM fields in general and I subsequently discovered a passion for computer programming. The term astronomical comes from astronomy and the grand scale of objects in the universe, however this could equally come from the vast data sets I've analyzed over the years. Through large all-sky surveys, astronomy has entered the era of big data. Statistical analysis of big data is always challenging but apparently I love challenges. To tackle big data problems I've learned about various mathematical and programming techniques which are also applicable to problems beyond astronomy. As I applied these methods I realized that I truly enjoyed the development of these concepts into solutions tailored to each specific data set. Over the years I've learned a lot of astrophysics and will always enjoy observing and contemplating our place in the universe. However, now I am ready to shift my skills to help out humanity here on Earth.
        In addition to my scientific research, I have also enjoyed teaching and mentoring. I have previously taught Science for a TASC preparation program and mentored high school students through astronomical research projects using computational techniques.
